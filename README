recover -- Extract JPEG/CR2 files from raw bytes (filesystem images etc.).

Purpose:
	This program can be used to extract accidentally deleted JPEG/CR2 images
	from any memory media (filesystem images, memory cards, etc).

Usage:
	$ make
	$ ./recover /dev/memory_card
	...and just watch image files appear in the CWD.

	-- alternatively --

	$ cc -O2 -o recover *.c
	$ ./recover /dev/memory_card

Warning:
	The program uses a fixed naming scheme (recovered%05d.EXT) and will
	happily overwrite any files with coinciding names in the CWD without
	warning.

Notes:
	* This program parses JPEG/CR2 structure while recovering, thus extracting
	  correct images, without relying on hacks.

	* CR2 recovery requires seeking on the device. If your device does not support
	  seeking, create an image or use the -r option to disable CR2 recovery.

	* If recovery of a CR2 file is not successful, the data is rescanned to save
	  at least JPEG thumbnails contained within.

	* CR2 recovery from large files will probably not work on Windows, due to
	  issues with fseek() and ftell() large-file variants.

	* If you're getting too much garbage, try using the -e option.

A (very rough) benchmark:
	On my 2.2GHz core2duo, a 1G CF card connected via USB is completely recovered
	in ~1.5 min, having CPU usage around 50% of one core -- the process is IO-bound.
