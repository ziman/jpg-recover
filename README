recover -- Extract JPEG files from raw bytes (filesystem images etc.).

Purpose:
	This program can be used to extract accidentally deleted JPEG images
	from any memory media (filesystem images, memory cards, etc).

Usage:
	$ cc -O2 recover.c -o recover
	$ ./recover /dev/memory_card
	...and just watch JPEG files appear in the CWD.

Warning:
	The program uses a fixed naming scheme (recovered%05d.jpg) and will
	happily overwrite any files with coinciding names in the CWD without
	warning.

A benchmark:
	I dumped 300 images from a 1G CF card in:
		real	1m35.379s
		user	0m39.362s
 		sys	0m5.468s
	The processor was 50% idle, which means the process was IO-bound.
